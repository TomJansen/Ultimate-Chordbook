\beginverse
\[E]I haven't thought of you in \[D]fifteen \[A]days and \[F#m]today I still won't t\[Bm]hink of you
\[E]And when I call you up and y\[D]ou're not \[A]home, well I \[Bm]might not even \[E]care
\[D]Every day gets better than the \[A]one before
\[D]Cause every day I know that I'm \[F#m]fine with\[E]out you\[D]
\[E]But I don't think about it
\endverse

\beginchorus
\[A]This one is \[E]not about \[A]you
You can \[D]put that in your \[F#m]pipe and \[E]smoke it
\[A]This one is \[E]not about \[A]you
Baby, \[D]you can take \[F#m]that to the \[E]bank
And \[Bm]shove it up your \[E]big fat \[A]ass
\endchorus

\beginverse
\[A]\[E]\[D]\[A]

\[E]Every time I ride \[D]past your \[A]house I \[F#m]forget it's you who's \[Bm]living there
\[E]Anyway I never \[D]see your \[A]face cause your \[Bm]window's up too \[E]high
\[D]And I saw you shopping at the \[A]grocery store
But I was \[D]far too busy with my \[F#m]cart to \[E]notice\[D]
\[E]You weren't looking at me

\[A]This one is \[E]not about \[A]you
You can \[D]put that in your \[F#m]pipe and \[E]smoke it
\[A]This one is \[E]not about \[A]you
Baby, \[D]you can take \[F#m]that to the \[E]bank
And \[Bm]shove it up your \[E]big fat \[A]ass

\beginverse
\[E]I saw that movie where the \[D]guy gets \[A]dumped when the \[F#m]girl goes off to \[Bm]find herself
\[E]But I think I may have \[D]missed the \[A]end - there was \[Bm]something \[E]in my eye
\[D]But it doesn't matter how it \[A]all turns out
Because I \[D]know that guy'll be \[F#m]fine with\[E]out you\[D]
\[E]You shouldn't worry cause
